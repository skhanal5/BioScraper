A webscraping tool made with Instagram4J that allows users to go through any given Instgram profile and query through their
followers and filter out any followers based on a search criteria dependent on their biography. 

## Disclaimer

Using this program for an extended period of time along with sending numerous requests in a short period of time can result in your account being rate limited or shadow banned. A workaround for this currently in the works.

## Bug Reports / Feature Requests

If you encounter any problems with the program, please make an issue with an appropriate title, label, and a detailed response [here](https://github.com/skhanal5/BioScraper/issues). Similarly, if you have any requests for additional features to be added onto this bot, please submit an issue with the label "feature-request" [here](https://github.com/skhanal5/BioScraper/issues) describing the feature you would like added. I will do my best to look over these reports and requests in my spare time.

## Editing/Contributing to the Project

I am currently working on adding comments and making the code more comprehensive for all users. In the future, I will add a page to the [wiki](https://github.com/skhanal5/BioScraper/wiki) that will thoroughly explain how to use this repository as intended.
